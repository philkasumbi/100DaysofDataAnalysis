# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Data Analysis

This project focuses on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing a movie dataset using **Pandas** in Python and visualizing insights with **Power BI**.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
- Cleaned and prepared raw movie data for analysis.
- Handled missing values (votes, budget, runtime, release date, etc.).
- Standardized data formats (dates, numeric types, text).
- Removed irrelevant columns and extracted useful features (e.g., release country).

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Power BI** for visualization

## ðŸ“‚ Key Cleaning Steps
- Filled missing values using median values grouped by genre.
- Removed time component from release dates and formatted them as `Month Day, Year`.
- Converted numeric columns (`votes`, `budget`, `runtime`) to integers.
- Dropped rows with critical missing values in `budget` and `gross`.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations in Power BI
- Top 10 highest-grossing movies.
- Movies with the highest votes.
- Distribution of runtime across genres.
- Budget vs. Gross revenue relationship.
- Yearly trend of movie releases.
- Movies count by country.
- Genre popularity based on revenue and votes.

## ðŸš€ Outcome
The analysis provides clear insights into movie performance, audience preferences, and trends over time, enabling better data-driven decisions in the film industry.
